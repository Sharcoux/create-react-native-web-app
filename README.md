# Create React Native Web App

This package will help you create a React Native app with React Native Web, Webpack, Babel, and optionally Typescript fully configured.

## Install

```bash
    npm i -g create-rnweb
```

## Generate application skeleton

```bash
   create-rnweb
```

The program will ask you about the following details:

 * **display name**: This is the name your application will receive in the store and the web app.
 * **package name**: This is the name used for React-Native package. It should be a CamelCase name, like AwesomeProject.
 * **typescript**: You will be asked if you want to use typescript. You can say `y` or `yes` to accept, or anything else to decline.
 * **jest**: You will be asked if you want to use jest. You can say `y` or `yes` to accept, or anything else to decline.
 * **storybook**: You will be asked if you want to use storybook. You can say `y` or `yes` to accept, or anything else to decline.

 The script will then configure eslint and let you decide about your coding habits.
